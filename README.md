# 3D Software Renderer

## What is it?
It is my attempt at replicating (at least part of) the 3d graphics pipeline purely on the cpu, it is not meant for practical use, it is far too slow, it is primarily to help me learn and for fun.

## Resources/Credit
- I relied heavily on [scratchapixel](scratchapixel.com) to learn how to do perspective division, rasterization, and vertex attributes though I did not directly copy their code  
- I used [wikipedia rotation matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix) to find rotation matrices  
- I used llms to explain how parts of the process worked, and the current version of Rasterizer class triangleContains is written by claude entirely  
  
## Future
This project is not complete, I want to write a shader to get some very basic shading/lighting, load some interesting models and clean up the code.
